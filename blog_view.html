        <p style="size: 35px; text-align: left";>Your mental health influences how you think, feel, and behave in daily life. It also affects your ability to cope with stress, overcome challenges, build relationships, and recover from life’s setbacks and hardships.
            
            Strong mental health isn’t just the absence of mental health problems. Being mentally or emotionally healthy is much more than being free of depression, anxiety, or other psychological issues. Rather than the absence of mental illness, mental health refers to the presence of positive characteristics.<br> <br> <br> <br>People who are mentally healthy have:

            <br>-A sense of contentment.
            <br>-A zest for living and the ability to laugh and have fun.
            <br>-The ability to deal with stress and bounce back from adversity.
            <br>-A sense of meaning and purpose, in both their activities and their relationships.
            <br>-The flexibility to learn new skills and adapt to change.
            <br>-A balance between work and play, rest and activity, etc.
            <br>-The ability to build and maintain fulfilling relationships.
            <br>-Self-confidence and high self-esteem.
            Whether you’re looking to cope with a specific mental health problem, handle your emotions better, or simply to feel more positive and energetic, there are plenty of ways to take control of your mental health—starting today.
            <br>
            <br> Having solid mental health doesn't mean that you never go through bad times or experience emotional problems. We all go through disappointments, loss, and change. And while these are normal parts of life, they can still cause sadness, anxiety, and stress. But just as physically healthy people are better able to bounce back from illness or injury, people with strong mental health are better able to bounce back from adversity, trauma, and stress. This ability is called resilience.

            People who are emotionally and mentally resilient have the tools for coping with difficult situations and maintaining a positive outlook. They remain focused, flexible, and productive, in bad times as well as good. Their resilience also makes them less afraid of new experiences or an uncertain future. Even when they don't immediately know how a problem will get resolved, they are hopeful that a solution will eventually be found.</p>
